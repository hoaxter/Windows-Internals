I came across one of the standard tools called "Dependency Walker" which helps understand EXE and DLL files and their dependencies.
In the image below, I've opened the familiar Kernel32.dll file which lets the application interact with Win32 APIs. Also, we can see it lists all the sub-dependencies of DLL files along with the import and export functions on the right.
This tool gives a general idea of what Win32 APIs function an exe or DLL is calling. I just started using this to get an idea of how an application is interacting with the Windows Kernel in a high-level overview.
Although, there are many advanced tools. This tool is just for beginners who want to understand in an easier way.

Hope you all find this usefulðŸ˜€
